## Function

Function is a todo application based on the MIT productivity system (most important thing, todo, backburner).

This is an active side-project with estimated completion by May 1, 2021.

## Stack

- Angular 11+ (TS, RxJS, Firestore)
- Ionic (allows for browser, and native iOS/Android application development with the same codebase)
- Firestore (basic noSQL nested collections, and batch-writes)

## Features

- MIT todo system
- Integrations with Google Calendar (voice-activated reminders with google now added to backburner section, removing friction)
- Draggable elements between todo and backburner section

## How to run

- Clone repo
- Run `npm install` and install all necessary dependencies
- Run `ionic serve`

## Current status

- Authentication and routing works
- Dragging elements between todo and backburner sections work
- Currently, all todo and backburner elements are boilerplate and do not update, but this is en route
- Total application size: ~750k
